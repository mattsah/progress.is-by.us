# Available Components

As you probably gathered from the section about the [nano core](02-nano-core), inKWell is more
about helping you write the code you want in such a way that you can easily change behaviors, add
functionality, or create pluggable components.  That said, inKWell is not merely its core, and a
number of packages are already available for the most common development paradigms.

As with the core, functionality is just a quick composer call away.  For example:

```bash
composer require dotink/inkwell-events
```

Components provide classes, configs, and actions which allow you to easily add functionality to
inKWell for use in your application code.  Official components are considered part of the framework
but can be added or used on an as needed basis.  Currently available components include:

- Router
- Controllers
- Event Manager
- Views
- Auth
- ORM

Additional planned components are:

- Cache
- Logger

## Creating Custom Components

Creating inKWell components is easy.  Create a composer package with an `src` directory to contain
classes, interfaces, traits, etc.  Add your default configuration(s) to `plugin/config/default`
(use subdirectories for additional namespacing) and your default action(s) to `plugin/include/default`
then simply add the following to your `composer.json`:

```
"type": "opus-package",
"extra": {
	"opus": {
		"inkwell/framework": {
			"plugin/config"  : "config",
			"plugin/include" : "include"
		}
	}
}
```

Once you've got the package registered with [packagist](https://packagist.org/) simply run:

```bash
composer require package/name
```
